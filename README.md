# Map Polyfill

* A minimal Map polyfill written in TypeScript, unit tested using Jasmine and Karma.
* The polyfill is full featured when comparing to the native implementation of Map. Most native operations complete with an asymptotic time complexity of O(1).
* Built file size is 2 KB minified.

## Installation

Ensure that Node and npm are both installed.

Then, install gulp globally:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

Finally, install all development dependencies:

```
cd CLONED_REPO_DIR
npm install
```

Run the default gulp task to run the linter, run unit tests, build documentation, and build the required scripts.
